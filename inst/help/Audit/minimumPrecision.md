Objective: Obtaining a Minimum Precision
==========================

The precision is a measure of how much certainty there is in the estimate of the misstatement from testing a particular characteristic of a sample at a given level of sampling risk.

In statistical analysis, precision is expressed as the difference between the estimated most likely misstatement and the upper bound of the misstatement. By setting this sampling objective, you can design a sample that minimizes the difference between the estimated most likely misstatement and the upper bound of the misstatement to a certain percentage.

You should implement this objective if you aim to make an estimate of the population misstatement with a specified level of accuracy.

A smaller minimum required precision will result in a larger sample size, while a higher minimum required precision will result in a smaller sample size.
