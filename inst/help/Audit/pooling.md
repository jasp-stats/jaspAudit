Algorithm: Share Information Between Strata
===

By sharing information among strata, the information from various sources can be captured while preserving the unique traits of each stratum. Using the *Share stratum info* technique you choose to share information about the misstatement between strata. 

This approach is helpful in scenarios where there is diversity in stratum misrepresentations, but underlying similarities can be leveraged by sharing information. Sharing information strikes a balance between analyzing all strata collectively and independently, leading to more accurate and precise conclusions than solely analyzing each stratum independently.
