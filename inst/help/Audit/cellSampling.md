Selection Method: Cell Sampling
===

In the case of cell sampling, the population is divided into a set of intervals, the size <i>I</i> of which is computed by dividing the size of the sampling frame by the sample size. Within each interval, a sampling unit is selected by randomly drawing a number within each interval. This causes the space between the intervals <i>i</i> to vary. In a monetary unit sampling context, the cell sampling method has the property that all transactions larger than twice the interval will always be included in the final sample.
