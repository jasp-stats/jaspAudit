Selection Method: Fixed Interval Sampling
===

In fixed interval sampling, the population is divided into a set of intervals, the size <i>I</i> of which is computed by dividing the size of the sampling frame by the sample size. A starting point is randomly selected in the first interval and one sampling unit is selected throughout the population at each of the uniform intervals from the starting point. This causes the space between the intervals <i>i</i> to stay the same. In a monetary unit sampling context, the fixed interval method has the property that all transactions that are larger than the interval will always be included in the final sample.
