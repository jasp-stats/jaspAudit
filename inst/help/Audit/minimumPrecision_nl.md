Objective: Obtain a Minimum Precision
===

This objective should be enabled when you wish to estimate the misstatement in the the population as a whole with a specified level of uncertainty.

The precision is a measure of how much uncertainty there is in the estimate of the misstatement in the population at a given level of sampling risk. Typically in an audit, the precision is used to determine if enough work has been performed to effectively estimate the misstatement in the population.

In this analysis, the precision represents the difference between the estimated most likely misstatement in the population and the upper bound of the misstatement in the population. By enabling this sampling objective, you can design a sample that minimizes the difference between the estimated most likely misstatement and the upper bound of the misstatement to a certain percentage.

The value of the minimum precision affects the minimum sample size. A smaller minimum required precision will result in a larger sample size, while a higher minimum required precision will result in a smaller sample size.
