Selection Method: Modified Sieve Sampling
===

Modified sieve sampling (Hoogduin, Hall, & Tsay, 2010) starts by selecting a standard uniform random number *R* between 0 and 1 for each item in the population. Next, the sieve ratio *S* = *book value* / *R* is computed for each item by dividing the book value of that item by the random number. Lastly, the items in the population are sorted by their sieve ratio *S* (in decreasing order) and the top *n* items are selected for inspection.

In contrast to the classical sieve sampling method (Rietveld, 1978), the modified sieve sampling method provides precise control over sample sizes.
