Objective: Test Against Performance Materiality
===

The performance materiality, also known as the upper error limit, tolerable deviation rate, or tolerable misstatement, is a value established by the auditor that is below the overall materiality of financial reports. Its purpose is to reduce the likelihood that the total of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds the materiality of the financial reports as a whole.

In statistical analysis, the performance materiality represents the highest acceptable level of misstatement in the population being tested. By testing against this performance materiality, you can design a sample to determine whether the population as a whole contains misstatements that are deemed material (i.e. greater than the upper limit of tolerable misstatement).

This objective should be enabled when you wish to assess if the population has misstatements exceeding a specific limit (the performance materiality) using a sample from the population.

The required sample size will increase with a lower performance materiality and decrease with a higher performance materiality.
