Benford's Law
==========================

Benford's law states that the distribution of leading digits in a population 
naturally follows a certain distribution. In auditing, assessing whether a 
distribution of digits in the population conforms to Benford's law may 
provide additional evidence that the transactions in the population might need 
further investigation.

*Note:* Non-conformity to Benford's law does not necessarily indicate fraud. A 
Benford's law analysis should therefore only be used to acquire insight into 
whether a population might need further investigation.

#### Variable
Here you can provide the variable that contains the digits that should be tested against Benford's law or the uniform distribution. The value 0 will be omitted from the data.

#### Check digits
This option allows you to specify which digits you want to test against Benford's law or the uniform distribution. Possible options are:
- First (default): Checks only the first digit of the transactions against the specified distribution.
- First and second: Checks the first and second digit of the transactions against the specified distribution.
- Last: Checks only the last digit of the transactions against the specified distribution.

#### Reference distribution
This option allows you to specify which distribution you want to test the digits against. Possible options are:
- Benford's law (default): Test the digits against Benford's law.
- Uniform distribution: Test the digits against the uniform distribution.

#### Confidence
The confidence is related to the audit risk. The audit risk determines the risk that the auditor is willing to take to give an incorrect based on this analysis. More specifically, the audit risk is the inverse of the confidence of the analysis (audit risk = 1 - confidence).

#### Explanatory text
When checked, enables explanatory text in the analysis to help you interpret the procedure and the statistical results.

Default output
-------

#### Goodness-of-fit table
This table is the default output for the Benford's Law analysis.

- n: The total number of observations in the data set.
- X<sup>2</sup>: The value of the Chi-squared test statistic.
- df: Degrees of freedom associated with the Chi-squared test.
- p: The *p* value associated with the Chi-squared test.
- BF: The Bayes factor resulting from a non-informative prior.

Advanced output (tables)
-------

#### Frequency statistics
Produces a table containing, for every digit, the count, observed percentage in the population, and expected percentage under Benford's law or the uniform distribution.

#### Compare to reference distribution
Produces a plot that shows the observed distribution of digits in the population, compared to the expected distribution under the Benford's law or the uniform distribution.
